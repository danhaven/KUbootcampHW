					<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
					<p>There were several correlations discovered between health risks and socioeconomic factors. The biggest factors appear to be income related.  Those with lower income are far more likely to smoke or to be obese.    </p>

					<p>Some of the factors we looked at do not have much correlation.  Age correlates the least compared to the rest of the factors.</p>

					<p>States should use this data to direct their Population Health efforts to focus on specific communities where these factors are highest.  This would lead to lower a lower burden on the healthcare system and can help prevent several of the highest causes of early deaths in the country, including heart disease and lung cancer.</p>
